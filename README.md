_A living collection of notes, code, and ideas that I'm cultivating as I grow as a developer. Topics are interconnected and always evolving._

## What is a Digital Garden?

A Digital Garden is a different way of thinking about knowledge sharing. Unlike a traditional blog where posts are polished, dated, and static, a digital garden is:

- **Organic & Evolving:** Ideas grow and change over time, just like plants in a garden.
- **Exploratory:** Content is interconnected, allowing you to wander through topics freely.
- **Less Polished:** It's more about learning in public than publishing perfection.
- **Personal:** This is my space to experiment, document, and reflect on my journey as a developer.

## What You'll Find Inside 🌳

This garden is home to various knowledge areas, each at different stages of growth:

- 🌿 **LeetCode 75 Journey:** My detailed notes, solutions (with explanations in different programming languages), and key takeaways as I tackle the LeetCode 75 study plan. A space to hone my problem-solving skills.

- 🤖 **AI Creations (Coming Soon):** Explorations and projects using generative AI, machine learning models, and APIs.

- 🔌 **Arduino Projects (Coming Soon):** Hands-on experiments with hardware, from simple circuits to IoT prototypes.

- 🎨 **UX/UI Insights (Coming Soon):** Notes on design principles, user experience, and building intuitive interfaces.

## Tech Stack 🛠️

This digital garden is built with modern web technologies:

- **React** – Component-based UI framework
- **MDX** – Markdown with JSX support for rich, interactive content
- **TypeScript** – Type-safe JavaScript
- **Node.js** – JavaScript runtime environment
- Static site generation for optimal performance

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/dev-garden.git
cd dev-garden

# 2. Install dependencies
npm install

# 3. Start the development server
npm start
