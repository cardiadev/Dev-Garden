Hey there! 👋 I'm Carlos Diaz, and welcome to my digital garden—a space where I document my journey as a software developer, share what I'm learning, and cultivate knowledge as I grow.

## What is a Digital Garden?

Unlike a traditional blog with polished, dated posts, a digital garden is:

- **🌱 Organic & Evolving** - Ideas grow and change over time
- **🔗 Interconnected** - Topics link together naturally
- **📝 Learning in Public** - It's about the journey, not perfection
- **🧑‍💻 Personal** - My space to experiment and reflect

## What You'll Find Here

### LeetCode 75 Journey

I'm working through the LeetCode 75 study plan, documenting each problem with:
- Detailed explanations
- Multiple solution approaches
- Time and space complexity analysis
- My personal notes and insights

### TypeScript Deep Dives

As a passionate TypeScript developer, I'll be sharing:
- Best practices and patterns
- Utility types and advanced features
- Real-world examples from my projects
- Common pitfalls and how to avoid them

### Web Development

Exploring modern web technologies:
- React and Next.js patterns
- Performance optimization
- Accessibility best practices
- Design systems and UI/UX

## Why I'm Doing This

**Learning in public** is powerful. By documenting my journey:
1. I solidify my own understanding
2. I create a reference for my future self
3. I might help others on a similar path
4. I stay accountable to my learning goals

## My Background

I'm a **Software Developer** passionate about:
- Clean, maintainable code
- TypeScript and modern JavaScript
- Problem-solving through creative approaches
- Building user-friendly applications

## Let's Connect!

I'm always excited to connect with fellow developers:

- **GitHub**: [@cardiadev](https://github.com/cardiadev)
- **Twitter/X**: [@cardiadev](https://x.com/cardiadev)
- **LinkedIn**: [cardiadev](https://linkedin.com/in/cardiadev)
- **Portfolio**: [carlosdiaz.dev](https://carlosdiaz.dev)

## What's Next?

I've got plenty of content planned:
- TypeScript utility types guide
- LeetCode problem walkthroughs
- Web development tips and tricks
- Project case studies

This garden is just getting started, and it will evolve as I learn and grow. Feel free to explore, and don't hesitate to reach out if you have questions or suggestions!

Happy coding! 🚀
