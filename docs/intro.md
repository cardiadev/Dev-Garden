Welcome to my digital garden—a living space where I document my journey as a developer. This is part of my main portfolio at [carlosdiaz.dev](https://carlosdiaz.dev).

## What is a Digital Garden?

A digital garden is different from a traditional blog. It's:

- **🌱 Organic & Evolving:** Ideas grow and change over time, just like plants in a garden
- **🔗 Interconnected:** Topics link together naturally, allowing you to explore freely
- **📝 Learning in Public:** It's more about the journey than polished perfection
- **🧑‍💻 Personal:** My space to experiment, document, and reflect on my growth

## What You'll Find Here

This garden contains various knowledge areas at different stages of growth:

### 🌿 LeetCode 75 Journey

My detailed notes, solutions, and key takeaways as I work through the LeetCode 75 study plan. Each problem includes:
- Problem analysis and intuition
- Step-by-step approach
- Complexity analysis
- Fully commented code solutions

### 🤖 AI Creations _(Coming Soon)_

Explorations and projects using generative AI, machine learning models, and APIs.

### 🔌 Arduino Projects _(Coming Soon)_

Hands-on experiments with hardware, from simple circuits to IoT prototypes.

### 🎨 UX/UI Insights _(Coming Soon)_

Notes on design principles, user experience, and building intuitive interfaces.

## How to Navigate

Use the sidebar on the left to explore different sections. Topics are organized by category, and you can jump between related concepts as you explore.

## Let's Grow Together 🌱

This garden is a work in progress, and that's exactly the point. Feel free to explore, learn, and get inspired. If you have suggestions or want to connect, find me on:
